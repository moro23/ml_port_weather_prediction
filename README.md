# Port Weather Prediction

## Problem Statement
You work as a data scientist with a small team of data scientists for a cargo
shipping company based in Finland. 90% of goods are imported into Finland
via cargo shipping. You are tasked with saving 20% of the costs for cargo
operations at the port of Turku, Finland. This can be achieved by developing an
ML solution that predicts weather conditions at the port 4 hours in advance.
You need to monitor for possible rainy conditions, which can distort operations
at the port with human resources and transportation, which in turn affects
supply chain operations at the port. Your ML solution will help port authorities
to predict possible rain 4 hours in advance; this will save 20% of costs and
enable smooth supply chain operations at the port.

## Goal
To build an ML solution that will predict possible rain 4 hours in advance.
